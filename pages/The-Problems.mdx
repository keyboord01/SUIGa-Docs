# The Problems

This section outlines the key challenges within the SUI gaming ecosystem that SUIGa aims to address. Each problem highlights a specific area where gamers and developers currently face obstacles that impede their experience and growth potential on the SUI blockchain.

## 1. Difficulty Finding Friends Who Play SUI Games

Gamers often struggle to connect with others who share their interest in SUI games. This lack of connectivity hampers the social aspect of gaming, which is crucial for building a vibrant gaming community and enhancing the multiplayer experience.

## 2. Lack of Community Communication

The absence of a centralized community platform means that gamers have limited opportunities to showcase their NFTs, achievements, and other in-game assets. This diminishes their sense of accomplishment and recognition within the community, undermining the social rewards that motivate continued engagement.

## 3. No Unified Platform for All SUI Games

Currently, there is no single platform that aggregates all SUI games. This fragmentation makes it difficult for gamers to discover and access new and exciting games on the SUI blockchain, limiting the visibility and reach of new developments.

## 4. Challenges for Game Developers in Finding Players

Game developers face significant challenges in reaching potential players due to the fragmented nature of the SUI gaming landscape. Without a unified platform, it's difficult for developers to promote their games effectively and build a substantial user base.

## 5. DAO Mechanism for Community-Driven Decisions

While not a problem per se, the lack of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) mechanism for community-driven decisions is a missed opportunity. SUIGa plans to implement a DAO mechanism, allowing players with high rankings (e.g., gold rank) to participate in voting on proposals regarding the future development of games, thereby ensuring that the community has a say in the evolution of the gaming ecosystem.
