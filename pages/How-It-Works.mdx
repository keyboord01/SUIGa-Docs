# How It Works

Understanding the functionality of SUIGa is essential for both new users and gamers. Here's a detailed look at how our platform operates.

## 1. Game Listings

SUIGa features a dedicated games page where all SUI games are listed. Each game entry includes a link that directs users to the game, making it easy to find and access your favorite games.

## 2. Leaderboard Integration

We fetch and display the leaderboards from each gameâ€™s smart contracts. This integration provides real-time updates on player rankings and achievements, keeping the competitive spirit alive.

## 3. User Authentication

Users connect their SUI wallet to the platform for authentication. This method ensures secure and seamless access to all features on SUIGa.

## 4. User Profiles

Every user has a profile where they can showcase their achievements, NFTs, badges, and XP points. These profiles are publicly viewable, fostering a sense of accomplishment and community recognition.

## 5. Communication Tools

SUIGa includes features that allow users to chat with each other. This facilitates communication, collaboration, and the formation of friendships within the gaming community, for a better social experience.

## 6. On-Chain Voting System

SUIGa incorporates an on-chain voting system for the DAOs of games. Players, especially those with high rankings, can participate in voting on proposals that influence the future development and direction of the games. This ensures that the community has a significant role in decision-making processes.
