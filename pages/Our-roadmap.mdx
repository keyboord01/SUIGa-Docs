# Our Roadmap

The roadmap for SUIGa outlines our commitment to continuously enhance the platform by introducing new features and functionalities. Here are the key milestones we aim to achieve in the coming periods.

## 1. Game Integration

We will continuously add more games to SUIGa. Each game requires individual attention as they operate with unique smart contracts. This ongoing effort ensures a growing and diverse library of games for our users, providing an expansive and engaging gaming experience on the SUI blockchain.

## 2. Profile Feature Implementation

We will develop and launch the profile feature, allowing users to showcase their achievements. Achievements will be fetched on-chain, ensuring accuracy and real-time updates. This feature will enhance user engagement by allowing players to gain recognition within the community.

## 3. Chat and Friendship Features

We will implement chat and friendship functionalities, enabling users to communicate and connect with each other. These social features are designed to enhance the community experience on SUIGa, making it a more interactive and connected platform.

## 4. DAO Mechanism Development

We will introduce the DAO mechanism, allowing high-ranking players to participate in voting on game-related proposals. This feature ensures that the community has a voice in the future development and direction of the games on our platform. It promotes a collaborative and democratic environment where player input is valued and impactful.
